## FairXChange
Getting Started
Welcome to FairXChange, the rewards card that rewards everyone! 

Inspiration
After attending the SFU Fair Trade workshop and conducting our own research, we’ve gathered Fairtrade’s three core values that truly makes it an organization worth supporting. For starters, they have a people over profit mentality, and we can see this front and center in the programs and initiatives that they’ve created. They’ve helped support a network of over 1.6 million farmers and workers in Fairtrade certified producer organizations, and support over 1,400 of these organizations across 73 countries. Their second core value is providing these laborers and families with financial freedom. This is accomplished through their minimum price guarantee, ensuring farmers that they can continue to manage and produce their crops sustainably, without having to worry about market fluctuation. Lastly, Fairtrade is committed to being transparent. As an organization that has the support of many stakeholders around the world, they conduct their business in a manner that reflects the people they support; humble, hardworking, and human.    
Through our research, we’ve also identified three main challenges Fairtrade faces that prohibits them from taking that next big step. One is the lack of awareness. A lack of visibility and knowledge regarding the impact of Fair Trade principles means that there is minimal support for the movement. Another challenge is the disconnect between farmers and laborers in these developing countries, and the consumers of their goods. Sometimes, it can be difficult to relate to the hardships that they face because the reality of their situations is so unimaginable. Lastly, there are a ton of misconceptions when it comes to Fairtrade, what it is, and how to tell authentic fair trade products from “fair washing”. With these challenges in mind, we set out to create a solution that is realistic, easy to understand, and most importantly, speaks to their core values we mentioned earlier.
